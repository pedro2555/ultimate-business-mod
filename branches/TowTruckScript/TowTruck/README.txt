As of beta versions, pressing Q spawns a packer near you.

Enter a packer and hold down the action button untill the player exists the truck (it is easily identified on screen), this will cause you to have the trailer controller.
Approach a car and hold down the action button again, the car should be teleport to the back of the truck.
Drive around.
To unload, repeat the process to get the controller.
Exit the truck and hold down the action button next to it.

Tip: An yellow arrow should show on top of truck when you have the controller.
